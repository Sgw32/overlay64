Firmware:

- Automatic notification only make sense when a line actually changes
  each time the user presses switches, counters, toggles etc. Does not
  make sense when a key sets a specific bit pattern, since then the
  notification is only triggered when the values change, not if that
  key is pressed repeatetly. So a control line is needed anyways if a
  screen also has such lines.

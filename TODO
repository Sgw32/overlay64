Firmware:

- Each screen gets its own set of rows and these will get referenced
  from the main row array. Otherwise empty but allocated rows will
  always show the backdrop, and two screens using the same lines will
  cause flicker...

- Each screen may only NULL a main row if the current row pointer is
  its own. So screens will get Screen_enable() and Screen_disable().

- Automatic notification only make sense when a line actually changes
  each time the user presses switches, counters, toggles etc. Does not
  make sense when a key sets a specific bit pattern, since then the
  notification is only triggered when the values change, not if that
  key is pressed repeatetly. So a control line is needed anyways if a
  screen also has such lines.
